# Commands

A list of commands that can be used on this bot. `<angle brackets>` denote options you have to pass to the command for it to work, and `[square brackets]` denote optional parts that can be omitted.

**Note:** This list uses the prefix `~` (a tilde), which is the bot's default prefix but may not be the same as the prefix set for any given server. When in doubt, mention the bot at the beginning of your message instead of using a prefix - this is valid in any server.

## `~about`
Displays information about the bot, including running version, time since last crash, and a link to its source code.

## `~choose <option>, <option>, [more options...]`
Chooses a random option from a list of comma-separated options. If you want to include a comma in an option, escape it with a backslash.

## `~color <any valid CSS color>`
Gets alternate writings of a CSS color, plus a preview.

## `~help [command]`
Displays a list of commands. Include a command name to get information about that command.

## `~npm [search]`
Searches for, and get information on, npm packages.

## `~ping`
Pings the bot.

## `~roll <dice roll>`
Rolls some dice. Supported roll formats are `AdX` for `A` rolls of an `X`-sided die. `A` can be omitted to mean 1 and `X` can be % (a percent sign) to mean 100. Multiple rolls can be separated by spaces.
